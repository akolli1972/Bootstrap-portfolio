                              <p>My name is Aruna Kolli. I prefer to be called by my first name. My family is my husband and two sons.
                                   I have been in the United States for 18 years. I have a Masters Degree in Psychology. Teaching has been my profession for about 20 years.
                                    Since learning has no boudaries or limits, i decided to learn something from the technology side, after 20 years of hibernation. 
                                    Feel like my brain has frozen for so many years, so need to challenge it now. Web designing seemed pretty cool, more so because I always have been a critic of how webpages were designed. 
                                    Today's trend in careers is Business combined with technology.I wanted to take this a little further and have Business with technology and Psychology.
                                     So here i am, learning a totally new course from the technology side with absolutely no background knowledge in this field. I have the passion to learn though, may be slow than others but i will learn and thank myself later for doing this. </p>
