        <p style ="text-align: justify">
          My name is Aruna Kolli. I prefer to be called by my first name. My
          family is my husband and two sons. I was born in India and moved to the 
          US in 2002. I have been in the United States for 18 years. I have a
          Masters Degree in Psychology. Teaching has been my profession for about 
          20 years. Since learning has no boudaries or limits, i decided to learn 
          something from the technology side.  Web designing seemed pretty cool,
          more so because I always have been a critic of how webpages were
          designed. Today's trend in careers is Business combined with
          technology.I wanted to take this a little further and have Business
          with technology and Psychology. So here i am, learning a totally new
          course from the technology side with absolutely no background
          knowledge in this field. I have the passion to learn though, and will
          thank myself later for doing this.  My passion to learn will take me far.
